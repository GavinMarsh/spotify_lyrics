Basic program that finds the current song playing on my Spotify account and then uses web scraping to display the lyrics.
Requires the Spotipy python module, which can be found here: https://github.com/plamere/spotipy. Public and private SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID's can be created at https://developer.spotify.com/. In order to verify your client credentials, you need to run a program (I used a basic socket server) at the Spotipy redirect URI. in this case, http://localhost:8080/.
